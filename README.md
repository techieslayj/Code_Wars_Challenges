# Code_Wars_Challenges
Folders of completed challenges in both Python and Swift from www.codewars.com

I wanted to help everyone out if they are having some trouble with Code Wars challenges. I've tried to highlight each step 
of my thought process. Feel free to share your intuition and any insight in to other ways to solve these. 

Thank you. Enjoy.
